          The Document Type Declaration needs to be present at the beginning of a document that uses
          the HTML syntax. It may optionally be used within the XHTML syntax, but it is not required.
          The following DOCTYPE is strongly recommended for most HTML documents:
        </p>
        <p>
          Example:
          The HTML5 DOCTYPE declaration.
          <code><!DOCTYPE html></code>
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="main-section" id="Elements">
        <header>Elements</header>
        <p>
          There are five different kinds of elements: normal, void, raw text, RCDATA and foreign elements.
          Each is represented syntactically by a tag. While the types have some similarities to each other,
          they are distinguished by their syntactic requirements for their content models and the types of tags
          that may be used.
        </p>
        <div class="sub-section" id="Tags">
          <h2>Tags</h2>
          <p>
            All elements are identified by their tag name and are marked up using either start tags and end
            tags or self-closing tags. A start tag marks the beginning of an element, while an end tag marks
            the end. Start tags are delimited using angle brackets with the tag name and any attributes in
            between. End tags are delimited by angle brackets with a slash before the tag name.
          </p>
        </section>
        <div class="sub-section" id="Void_Elements">
          <h2>Void Elements</h2>
          <p>
            The term void elements is used to designate elements that must be empty.
            These requirements only apply to the HTML syntax. In XHTML, all such elements are
            treated as normal elements, but must be marked up as empty elements.
          </p>
          <p>
            These elements are forbidden from containing any content at all. In HTML, these elements
            have a start tag only. The self-closing tag syntax may be used. The end tag must be omitted
            because the element is automatically closed by the parser.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="sub-section" id="Raw_Text_Elements">
          <h2>Raw Text Elements</h2>
          <p>
            The term raw text elements refers to elements within which the content is treated as raw text
            instead of markup. These requirements only apply to the HTML syntax. In XHTML, all such elements
            are treated as normal elements.
          </p>
          <p>
            These require a start tag and an end tag. Neither the self-closing tag syntax, nor optional tags
            are supported.
          </p>
          <p>
            These elements can only contain raw text. This means that other content like comments, character
            references and other elements cannot be represented in the HTML syntax. That is, the markup for such
            constructs is treated as text instead of markup. All occurrences of special characters do not need
            to be escaped as character references, as they otherwise would within normal elements.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="sub-section" id="RCDATA_Elements">
          <h2>RCDATA Elements</h2>
          <p>
            The term RCDATA elements refers to elements within which character references are supported,
            but all other content is treated as raw text instead of markup. These requirements only apply to
            the HTML syntax. In XHTML, all such elements are treated as normal elements.
          </p>
          <p>
            These require a start tag and an end tag. Neither the self-closing tag syntax, nor optional tags
            are supported.
          </p>
          <p>
            These elements can only contain text or character references. This means that only character
            references are treated as markup, whereas all other content like comments and other elements
            cannot be represented in the HTML syntax. That is, the markup for such constructs is treated as text.
          </p>
          <p>
            Occurrences of special characters may, but generally do not need to be escaped as character
            references, as they otherwise would within normal elements. But this is subject to the additional
            restriction that the text cannot include an ambiguous ampersand. That is, an ampersand followed a sequence
            of characters that looks like a named character reference, but which is not valid.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="sub-section" id="Foreign_Elements">
          <h2>Foreign Elements</h2>
          <p>
            The term foreign elements refers to elements that are in the SVG and MathML namespaces.
          </p>
          <p>
            These require a start tag and an end tag. The self-closing tag syntax may be used, where the
            element's content model permits. Optional tags are not supported.
          </p>
          <p>
            These elements can contain text, character references, CDATA sections, other elements, and
            comments, but the text must not contain the less-than sign character (<) or an ambiguous ampersand.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="sub-section" id="Normal_Elements">
          <h2>Normal Elements</h2>
          <p>
            Normal Elements refers to all other HTML elements that are not categorised in any of the other types.
          </p>
          <p>
            These have a start tag and an end tag. These elements do not support the self-closing tag syntax.
            Certain elements have optional tags, meaning that one or both tags may be omitted in specific
            circumstances where the presence of the tag will be implied by surrounding markup. Consult the
            element definitions to see which tags may be omitted.
          </p>
          <p>
            Normal elements can contain text, character references, other elements, and comments, but the text
            must not contain the less-than sign character (<) or an ambiguous ampersand. Some additional
            restrictions apply on a per-element basis to some specific elements. Consult the element definitions
            for details.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <section class="main-section" id="Attributes">
        <header>Attributes</header>
        <p>
          Elements may have attributes that are used to specify additional information about them.
          Some attributes are defined globally and can be used on any HTML element, while others are defined
          for specific elements only. Every attribute must have an attribute name that is used to identify it.
          Every attribute also has an associated attribute value, which, depending on the attribute's definition,
          may represent one of several different types. The permitted syntax for each attribute depends on the given
          value.
        </p>
        <p>
          A typical attribute in HTML has a name and a value separated by an equals sign (=). Attributes are
          placed within a start tag and are separated from the tag name and from each other by whitespace.
          They must not be specified within an end tag.
        </p>
        <h3>Example:</h3>
        <p>
          The syntax of two typical attributes.
          <code><div class="example" lang="en">...</div></code>
        </p>
        <h3>Example Error:</h3>
        <p>
          Attributes cannot be placed within end tags.
          <code><section id="example">...</section id="example"></code>
        </p>
        <div class="sub-section" id="Empty_Attribute_Syntax">
          <h2>Empty Attribute Syntax</h2>
          <p>
            An empty attribute is one where the value has been omitted. This is a syntactic shorthand for
            specifying the attribute with an empty value, and is commonly used for boolean attributes. This
            syntax may be used in the HTML syntax, but not in the XHTML syntax.
          </p>
          <h3>HTML Example:</h3>
          <p>
            Empty attributes may have their value omitted in the HTML syntax.
            <code><input disabled>...</code>
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="sub-section" id="Unquoted_Attribute_Value_Syntax">
          <h2>Unquoted Attribute Value Syntax</h2>
          <p>
            An unquoted attribute value is one where the value is supplied, but is not surrounded by
            quotation marks. This syntax may be used in the HTML syntax, but not in the XHTML syntax.
          </p>
          <p>
            The attribute value must not contain any literal space characters, any of the characters:
            double quote ("), apostrophe ('), equals sign (=), less-than sign (<), greater-than sign (>),
            or grave accent (`), and the value must not be the empty string. To represent those characters in an
            attribute value, they either need to be escaped using character references, or you need to use either
            the single- or double-quoted attribute values.
          </p>
          <h3>HTML Example:</h3>
          <p>
            Some attribute values may be left unquoted in the HTML syntax.
            <code><img src=example.png height=200 width=300/></code>
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="sub-section" id="Double-Quoted_Attribute_Value_Syntax">
          <h2>Double-Quoted Attribute Value Syntax</h2>
          <p>
            An double-quoted attribute value is one where the supplied value is surrounded by double quotation
            marks ("). This syntax may be used in both HTML and XHTML.
          </p>
          <p>
            The attribute value must delimited by double-quote characters (") before and after the value,
            and must not contain any double-quote characters or an ambiguous ampersands in between. All other
            text and character references are permitted.
          </p>
          <p>
            The advantage of quoting attributes, the value may contain the additional characters that can’t
            be used in unquoted attribute values. To include a double-quote character within the value, either
            use a character reference (&quot;), or use a single-quoted attribute value instead.
          </p>
          <h3>Example:</h3>
          <p>
            Attribute values may be quoted with double quote marks.
            <code><img src="example.jpg" title="An example photograph"></code>
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="sub-section" id="Single-Quoted_Attribute_Value_Syntax">
          <h2>Single-Quoted Attribute Value Syntax</h2>
          <p>
            An single-quoted attribute value is one where the supplied value is surrounded by single quotation
            marks ('). This syntax may be used in both HTML and XHTML.
          </p>
          <p>
            The attribute value must delimited by single-quote characters (') before and after the value, and
            must not contain any single-quote characters or an ambiguous ampersands in between. All other text
            and character references are permitted.
          </p>
          <p>
            The advantage of quoting attributes, the value may contain the additional characters that can’t
            be used in unquoted attribute values. To include a single-quote (or apostrophe) character within
            the value, either use a character reference (&apos;), or use a double-quoted attribute value instead.
          </p>
          <h3>Example:</h3>
          <p>
            Attribute values may be quoted with single quote marks.
            <code><img src='example.jpg' title='An example photograph'></code>
